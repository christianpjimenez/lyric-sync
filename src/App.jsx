          I can't remember when you looked at me and cried
        </p>
        <p>
          Said something broke inside of you <br></br>
          Were my best friend
          Whatever come our way, you know I'm your girl 'til the end

          And when I'll finally go away
          I know you'll look for me one day

          When you let love down
          Oh, you let love down
          I don't have to remind you, but you know that I'm around
          When you let love down
          Oh, you let me down
          Get a little let down
          Let it down

          I can't remember when you put your hand on mine
          But couldn't play in time
          When we, yeah, when we're not together
          Just sing a little song
          Blueberry kisses forever
        </p>
